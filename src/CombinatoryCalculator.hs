-- |CombinatoryCalculator is a simple DSL for interpreting SKI-combinatory
-- calculus using normal reduction order and parentheses-free notation. The main
-- idea is to use alphabet {A,S,K,I} for reprsenting the S, K, and I combinators
-- and an application operator A. Expressions are represented as strings (a.k.a.
-- lists) of these symbols using infix notation. An applicative expression in
-- SKI-combinatory calculus of the form "(e f)" translates into [A,e,f].
